=========================

Java API for android acoustic echo cancellation.

NOTE
=========================
  1. This post is based on WebRTC branches-3.31-[http://webrtc.googlecode.com/svn/branches/3.31/], and I haven't update the core process of AECM module for several monthes.

TODO List
=========================
  1. Provide a VoIP demo to show how to use this API instead of doing AECM on PCM files.
